Hello, there! 👋🏼

This repository may be unusual for you if you come from my previous projects. Its main objective is to help me recall how Java works.

I began my journey with Java back in 2019 and, since then, I have used to built videogames and mobile apps. However, since 2021 I haven't
touched once it as I wanted to experiment more with other programming paradigms, languages and because I decided to mainly focus on Python
due to my Master's degree. Feel free to review the code and point out errors it may have (it would help me very much to continue improving).

Thanks and if you wanna talk or something you can find my links on my profile 😺.
